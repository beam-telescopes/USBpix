In this folder you can find example code on how to process source scan 
or externally triggered raw data files as produced by STcontrol (and
actually also by TurboDAQ)

simple_ana.cpp - contains a simple root macro plotting a hit map and 
ToT histogram(s) from a single raw-data file

raw_to_tree.cpp and cluster.cpp belong together - raw_to_tree pre-processes 
the data such that they can be analysed cy cluster. Both need to be compiled
with main.cpp and linked to root libraries via the QT projects:
in USBpix main directory, call setup, then in this directory:
qmake
(n)make

To use the raw_to_tree functionality, call from a command line
Data_Conversion_tree --conv --tag <input data tag> -i <first index> -f <last index>
to use the cluster functionality, call
Data_Conversion_tree --clus --tag <input data tag> -i <first index> -f <last index>
to call both sequentially, call
Data_Conversion_tree --all --tag <input data tag> -i <first index> -f <last index>

They can process a set of files with subsequent indices in the file name
(like data_1.raw, data_2.raw etc.)
