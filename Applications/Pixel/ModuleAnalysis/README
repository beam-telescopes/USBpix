README for ModuleAnalysis
=========================


= Building =

ModuleAnalysis needs several libraries to build: The Pixel DAQ libraries as well as
QT 3 (tested with several QT 3 versions on linux and windows) and ROOT (tested
with 3.10/02). To find the former, it assumes a directory layout similar to the layout 
in CVS, and needs environment variables to be set which are evaluated in the makefile 
(also see Paolo Morettini's daq.csh or daq.sh). In particular, the following variables 
are used: MODULE_ANALYSIS, PIX_LIB, VME_INTERFACE, PIX_ANA
(the latter is new and should point to Applications/Pixel/PixAnalysis)

Depending on where an how you set up QT, you may want to set the following using
the correct QTDIR:

QTDIR=/opt/rccenv001/qt-3.3.0
PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export QTDIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH

***IMPORTANT CHANGE****
ModuleAnalysis now uses the QT project file to generate Makefiles for linux. Proceed as follows

* 'qmake -makefile'
* 'make'   to build an application
* 'make libModuleAnalysis.a' to build the library needed for STcontrol
