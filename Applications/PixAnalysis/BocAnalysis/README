  The BocScanAlgoritm can be found in PixAnalysis/BocAnalysis. Up to now, only analysis of 1- or 
  2-dimensional Boc Scans is supported.
   
  * overall principle
    The algoritm looks at a scan results and determines in which regions of the scanned parameter
    space, there have been errors. Regions of the parameter space which are not scanned are
    considered erroneous because there is no information about their behaviour. The algoritm then
    calculates the parameter sets which are furthest away possible from the erroneous regions in
    number of scan steps.
    Example: a scan with 3 steps in param 1 (verical), and 5 steps in param 2 (horizontal), could
    the following pattern, the numbers mean distance to the errors in scan steps, that is 0 means
    erroneous region.
    			 0 0 1 1 1
      			 0 1 2 2 1
 			 0 1 1 1 1
       
    In that simple case, the algoritm would recommend the settings marked by "2" here.
         
  * refining of the algoritm
  	
     The algorithm described above can for a 2-dim scan yield too many results when a good 
     parameter region is considerably longer in one parameter than in the other. Consider
     the following situation:

   			 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	 
    			 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
    			 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0
   		         0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
    			 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
	
    Here, the simple algorithm would recommend all 6 settings marked by "2", but in fact one
    would want to have only the middle two settings of them. For that reason, in a 2-dim scan,
    the algorithm looks for long connected "lines" of previously recommended settings which, and
    discards all of them but the middle ones.
    Note that there might in some cases be an ambiguity due to the choice in which direction 
    (horizontal or vertical) are looked for first. The algorithm uses the direction which has
    more scan steps first.

  * special case for phases 
   (Rx data delay, BPM clock phase, B clock phase, V-clock 1 phase, Tx Bpm coarse delay)
  
    Since these parameters are phases, a delay of 25ns is equal to a delay of 0 ns. For that
    reason, 0ns and 24ns are considered as neighbours in the analysis. A scan of e.g. 25 steps
    in Rx data delay could therefore yield the following distance pattern:

  		  11 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
