/** @mainpage package CommonWithDsp
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *  This package contains C header files needed by both the DSP code and the
 *  host processor code (both the TestStand and RodModule code). A subdirectory
 *  contains the header files needed to support the ABCD chip.  In general,
 *  these headers contain descriptions of memory maps, hardware registers, and
 *  other data needed by both sides of the communication.
