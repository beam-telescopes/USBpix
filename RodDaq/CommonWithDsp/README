This directory contains header files needed by the DSPs and by the
host machines. They are a single place to specify necessary information and
define needed parameters. Accordingly, each user of these files must define one 
and only one of the following logical names by using a "-Dxxx" in the compile 
command or a including a "#define xxx" statement in the source code, where xxx 
is the logical name.

The possible logical names are:
   I_AM_MASTER_DSP
   I_AM_SLAVE_DSP
   I_AM_NT_HOST
   I_AM_LINUX_HOST
