Notes: 

/*** 8 January 2005 ***/

	Stop writing .bin files for primitives on host
	
x	Who resets reply buffer index? This is a host responsibility after the primitive list has been completed
	
	Should the reply buffer have additional structure?
	
x	Decouple primitive list source from system dependency. Need to give control and status locations.
	
x	Make the Host/Master interface more symmetrical with the Master/Slave interface, including nomenclature.
	
	PrimitiveListProc on master to handle the slave?

	How does one generate pin4 interrupts to the slave under software control?
	
/*** 9 January 2005 ***/

	Add version capability
	
	Add text buffer identification ( [MASTER], [SLAVEx], ... )
	
	Host: allocate Module structures as necessary ( permanent allocation )
	
	cast functions instead of using void * and setting to structure types
	
	common primitives need to be unified
	
/*** 10 January 2005 ***/

	delete revision fields in primitive header/trailer structures
	
/*** 11 January 2005 ***/

	reduce alloc chain
	
	heap marker algorithm
	
	ensure tanks are aligned on a 4 byte boundary
	
	add scrubber to heaps, tasks, etc...
	
	does 1 byte marker suffice for heap(s)?
	
	add permanent allocation heap
	
/*** 12 January 2005 ***/

	add dynamic primitive registering capability
	
	add file i/o
	
/*** 14 January 2005 ***/

	primLists should have a pointer to the queue to which they belong
