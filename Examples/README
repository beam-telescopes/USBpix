building of examples is based on QT projects. To build one of the applications, 
start from a command prompt in which the USBpix environment was initialised via 
the setup script, then go to the according sub-directory and call
qmake
(n)make clean
(n)make

To build all examples in one go, follow the same command sequence in the main Examples directory
