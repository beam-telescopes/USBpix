on CCentos7, xc3sprog can be built from source. cmake and the ftdi 
packages are required, so you might have to install that first:
add file elrepo.repo in this directory to /etc/yum.repos.d, then call:
sudo yum install cmake libftdi libftdi-devel

Building/installatuion - the last step will install into /usr/local, 
so you'll need root rights: best run the entire procedure as root:
svn co https://xc3sprog.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xc3sprog/trunk xc3sprog
cd xc3sprog
cmake . 
make 
make install
